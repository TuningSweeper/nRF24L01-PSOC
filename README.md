# nRF24L01 for PSoC 1

nRF24L01 drivers and sample projects for PSoC 1 series microcontrollers.

More to come.. so far contains simple basic TX and RX test routines.


## Adapter

Material for simple PCB adapter to mount the nRF24L01 to PSoC development board.


## nRF24L01_PER_Measurement

Sample procect files to measure Packet Error Rate (PER). TX device transmits packets with packet count, and the RX device figures out the number of lost and broken packets. Project files for CY8C27443-24PXI, but should work on other PSoC 1 devices too.
